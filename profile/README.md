# River Deep Mountain AI
[River Deep Mountain AI](https://www.cognizant.com/us/en/industries/ocean/rdmai) is an innovation project funded by the Ofwat Innovation Fund working collaboratively to develop open-source AI/ML models that can inform effective actions to tackle waterbody pollution.  
  
The UK’s water environment is under huge pressure from population growth, climate change and pollution. With 85% of English rivers currently failing to meet the Water Framework Directive’s requirements for ecological health, it’s estimated that as many as three rivers in four could pose a risk to human health. 

Confronted with challenges of this scale and complexity, the water sector needs innovative solutions to protect the health of our rivers and ensure clean water for future generations. 

This is why Northumbrian Water, in close collaboration with Cognizant Ocean, Xylem, WRc, ADAS, The Rivers Trust, Stream and six supporting water companies, are embarking on an exciting journey funded by the Ofwat Innovation Fund. The goal: To revolutionise insights into river health and water quality using state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) and remote sensing technologies.  

## The scope
The scope of RDMAI model development has been selected based on environmental impact, stakeholder needs, scalability and the potential of AI to provide benefits over current approaches. The project focus is divided into three themes: 

- **Theme 1:** Modelling high-priority pollutants.
- **Theme 2:** Designing an optimised monitoring plan.  
- **Theme 3:** Getting more value from continuous monitoring.  

Within each themes, multiple AI/ML models are currently under development. The first version of the models has already been released open-source here, and the second version towards the end of the project, in November 2025. 

## Collaboration
In River Deep Mountain AI we believe that solutions to big challenges come through collaboration, transparency and a systemic approach. These principles underpin the project throughout and we have implemented several ways of working that help to support this. These include; cross-sector partnerships, co-creation with stakeholders, building for scale, and most importantly knowledge-sharing.
