# River Deep Mountain AI :ocean:
[River Deep Mountain AI](https://www.cognizant.com/us/en/industries/ocean/rdmai) is an innovation project funded by the Ofwat Innovation Fund working collaboratively to develop open-source AI/ML models that can inform effective actions to tackle waterbody pollution.  
  
The UK’s water environment is under huge pressure from population growth, climate change and pollution. With 85% of English rivers currently failing to meet the Water Framework Directive’s requirements for ecological health, it’s estimated that as many as three rivers in four could pose a risk to human health. 

Confronted with challenges of this scale and complexity, the water sector needs innovative solutions to protect the health of our rivers and ensure clean water for future generations. 

This is why [Northumbrian Water](https://www.nwl.co.uk/), in close collaboration with [Cognizant Ocean](https://www.cognizant.com/dk/en/industries/ocean), [Xylem](https://www.xylem.com/en-uk/), [WRc](https://www.wrcgroup.com/), [ADAS](https://adas.co.uk/), [The Rivers Trust](https://theriverstrust.org/), [Stream](https://www.streamwaterdata.co.uk/) and four supporting water companies, have embarked on an exciting journey funded by the Ofwat Innovation Fund. The goal: To revolutionise insights into river health and water quality using state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) and remote sensing technologies.  

## The models
The scope of RDMAI model development has been selected based on environmental impact, stakeholder needs, scalability and the potential of AI to provide benefits over current approaches. As part of an early release, we have open sourced the first batch of AI/ML and remote sensing models. This includes: 

:cyclone: [**Open Flow Model:**](https://github.com/Cognizant-RDMAI/Open-Flow-Model) Using AI/ML to estimate daily mean river flow in ungauged rivers.

:ocean: [**Open E. coli Model:**](https://github.com/Cognizant-RDMAI/Open-Ecoli-Models) Using AI/ML to predict E. coli concentrations and risks in bathing waters.  

:globe_with_meridians: [**Open Slurry Tank Detection Model:**](https://github.com/Cognizant-RDMAI/Open-SlurryTanks-Detection-Model) Using remote sensing and computer vision to identify and map slurry tanks across river catchments.

:ear_of_rice: [**Open Bare Cropland Detection Model:**](https://github.com/Cognizant-RDMAI/Open-Bare-Cropland-Detection-Model) Using remote sensing to identify winter bare cropland.

:earth_americas: [**Open Risk Map:**](https://github.com/Cognizant-RDMAI/Open-Risk-Map) Collating catchment data to map pollution hotspots and risk areas.  

:droplet: [**Open Orthophosphate Model:**](https://github.com/Cognizant-RDMAI/Open-Orthophosphate-Model) Using AI/ML to predict Orthophosphate concentrations in river catchments.

:globe_with_meridians: [**Open Poached Land Detection:**](https://github.com/Cognizant-RDMAI/Open-Poached-Land-Detection) Leveraging machine learning and remote sensing to detect soil degradation.

All AI/ML and remote sensing models from RDMAI are still under development and the second versions will be released towards the end of the project, in November 2025. 

## Collaboration
In River Deep Mountain AI we believe that solutions to big challenges come through collaboration, transparency and a systemic approach. These principles underpin the project throughout and we have implemented several ways of working that help to support this. These include; cross-sector partnerships, co-creation with stakeholders, building for scale, and most importantly knowledge-sharing.
